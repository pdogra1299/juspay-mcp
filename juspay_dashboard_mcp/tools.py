Required inputs:

Extraction patterns (ALWAYS follow these steps):
1. Remove the last '-' and number (e.g., '-1', '-2') from the end
2. If there's still a '-' and number at the end, remove that too (for silent retries)  
3. Take the part after the merchant prefix (usually after the first or second hyphen)

Examples:

NOTE: If any EMI option is enabled in payment_filter.emiOptions, at least one card type (credit/debit/cardless) must be enabled within that EMI type.
EMI OPTIONS: If the user requests EMI options, ask them to choose from: 1) Standard EMI (standardEmi), 2) Low Cost EMI (lowCostEmi), 3) No Cost EMI (noCostEmi).
For each selected EMI type, ask which card types to enable: credit cards (standard_credit/low_cost_credit/no_cost_credit), debit cards (standard_debit/low_cost_debit/no_cost_debit), or cardless EMI (standard_cardless/low_cost_cardless/no_cost_cardless).
Please note that it's extremely necessary to ask the user which EMI OPTIONS they want if the user asks for them.
Set showEmiOption to true only if any EMI option is requested.
RECREATE FROM ORDER: If the user asks to recreate a payment link and provides an order ID, first call the 'juspay_get_order_details' tool with that order_id to fetch the existing order details, then use those details (amount, customer information, payment methods, etc.) to create a new payment link with the same parameters.
CRITICAL : If all the necessary parameters are provided do not ask for confirmation from the user, directly create the payment link.

Also, if the user asks to send an email, prompt the user to specify the email (shouldSendMail should be enabled), and similarly if the user asks to send SMS (shouldSendSMS should be enabled) or WhatsApp message (shouldSendWhatsapp should be enabled), prompt the user to ask for the mobile number if not already specified , the user should be prompted for the email ID and phone number if they want to send email and sms or Whatsapp message.
If the user does not ask to send the email , WhatsApp message or SMS then do not mark the fields - shouldSendMail,shouldSendSMS and shouldSendWhatsapp as true.

**When to call this tool:**
- When asked about integration status, progress, or completion for a specific merchant
- To check which integration stages/items have passed or failed
- To identify action items and next steps for integration completion
- When troubleshooting integration issues or blockers
- To view detailed stage-wise breakdown of integration checklist
- When user asks about integration status and doesn't mention platform or product_integrated, first call `juspay_integration_platform_metrics` to get the default platform, then `juspay_integration_product_count_metrics` to get the default product_integrated for that platform, then call this tool with both.

**Tool capabilities:**
- Platform-aware monitoring (Backend uses agnostic API, Web/Android/iOS use nonagnostic API)
- Stage-wise integration progress tracking with pass/fail status
- Critical vs non-critical stage identification for prioritization
- Feature-wise analysis (base payments, mandate, payout, etc.)
- Visibility conditions and actionable results for each stage
- Integration checklist completion tracking

**Required inputs:**
- platform: Must be one of "Backend", "Web", "Android", "iOS"
- product_integrated: Must be one of "Payment Page Signature", "Payment Page Session", "EC + SDK", "EC Only"
- merchant_id: Merchant ID
- start_time / end_time: ISO format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ. Convert natural language windows (last N days) to absolute timestamps.
- Date range limit: only last 45 days of data is available — refuse older windows.
- Default range: last 30 days when the user doesn't specify one.

**Response provides:**
- Overall integration completion status with critical stage counts
- Feature-wise progress breakdown (base, mandate, payout, etc.)
- Section-wise analysis (e.g., "Payments Flow Checklist")
- Individual stage details with pass/fail status, criticality level, and action items
- Module metadata including platform dependencies and minimum requirements

Use this tool to monitor integration progress, identify failed stages that need attention, and provide actionable guidance for completing merchant integrations.""",

This tool provides X-Mid validation results for API transactions within a specified time range, helping merchants monitor the validation status of their X-Mid headers across different API endpoints.

Key features:
- Time-range based X-Mid validation monitoring
- API shortcode-wise validation results
- PASSED/FAILED validation status tracking
- Merchant-specific validation data

- To determine which platforms are configured for a merchant
- When you need to get the default platform for subsequent API calls
- When asked about integration progress across different platforms
- To compare integration completion between Android, iOS, Web, and Backend platforms
